# Hosting
This will provide a list of free and paid hosting providers. 

## Free Options
| Hosting Provider | Pros and Cons of each provider |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
| [Oracle Cloud Free Tier](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free) | Oracle Cloud is remarkable in that it is free. You can pretty much get a full VPS (virtual private server) experience for no cost to you. |
| [Repl.it](https://repl.it) | Replit is a well known hosting option. It provides free hosting as well as a web code editor. However, hosting proxies violates Replit's terms of service and can result in your account getting suspended or permanently banned. |
| [Heroku](https://heroku.com) | Heroku, much like Replit, is a well known free hosting option. Hosting proxies on Heroku can also result in your account being suspended or permenantly banned. |
| [Glitch](https://glitch.com) | Glitch is very similar to Replit in that it is well known and provides a web code editor. As far as I am aware, hosting proxies on Glitch is not a violation of their terms of service, however, assuming hosting proxies is a violation of Glitch's terms of service, it is still largely unenforced. |

## Paid Options
| Hosting Provider | Pros and Cons of each provider |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
| [Contabo](https://contabo.com) | Contabo is a widely used hosting service that has very good specs for the cheapest prices. There are many issues with Contabo though, such as bad customer service and port speeds. |
| [Dedipath](https://dedipath.com) | Dedipath is a great hosting provider in all categories. With fairly cheap servers with good specs, they are a go-to solution for many. |
| [OVH Cloud](https://ovhcloud.com) | OVH Cloud is a well-known hosting provider, with cheap and good servers and speeds. Some issues are that customer support is more on the poor side, and servers may take some time to be set up. |
