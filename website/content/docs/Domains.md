Once you've got hosting down, you need to purchase domains for your instance of a site. This will list some of, what I believe to be, the most useful places to register a domain.

| Registar | Reasons to Use and Reasons Not to Use |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com) | Porkbun is notoriously known for being very inexpensive. At some points, domains ending in `.xyz` or `.top` will be sold by porkbun for less than a dollar. 
| [Njalla](https://njal.la) | Njalla is the most expensive option on this list. For some, it is worth the price for the benefits that come with it, but for most, it is not recommended. The cheapest domains that they offer start at ~$15 USD. |
| [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) | Namecheap is cheap. You can purchase a `.com` domain for as little as $0.98 USD, however they are usually not that inexpensive. Porkbun beats them in price for some TLDs. |
| [Freenom](https://www.freenom.com) | Freenom offers some domains for free for 1 year. The problem with Freenom Domains, however, is that the free TLDs that they offer are blocked by most web filters by default. I would only recommend Freenom as a last resort if all other option aren't viable for your uses. |
